# Ecomm-Backend
In this project we were assigned to create the backend to an application that already had the front end done. after creating the backend for the app we were supposed to connect everything and build the routes to make sure everything works. Once everything was connected we had to turn our server on and test our routes in Insomnia. I then had to record everything to make sure the app was working. The biggest challenge I faced was getting the server to start but thank god for the TA who helped me figure out why my server wasn't starting. I did enjoy doing this project since I plan on pursuing a career being a backend developer.
